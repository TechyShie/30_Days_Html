    <h1 style="color:violet">TechyShie Restarts Her Coding Challenge A New</h1>

    <p>
      I'm restarting my coding challenge from the very beginning.
      I started this journey in September 2023, when I joined the
      Cooperative University of Kenya to pursue a Diploma in Computer Science.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the two years I spent there, I got a bit of understanding —
      or maybe just an idea — of what the industry is all about.
      About coding, I didn’t learn much since the syllabus mainly focused on theory.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also didn’t have a laptop at the time, so exploring the concepts
      we learned in class wasn’t really possible.
      We had a computer lab, but access was limited due to ongoing classes.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <p>
      Towards the end of 2024, I was required to apply for tech internships
      as part of my coursework, but I failed to do so.
      Instead, I got something better.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through a friend, I landed an opportunity at the Moringa Bootcamp
      to pursue a Software Development course that took six months.
      Here, I really learned a lot because the focus was on practical work.
    </p>

    <p>
      I finally understood simple terms like backend and frontend development,
      did a couple of projects, collaborated on others, and by God’s grace,
      graduated in November 2025.
    </p>

    <p>
      I took a short break from coding, but here I am again —
      on the 1st of January 2026.
      New year. New resolutions.
    </p>

    <p>
      During bootcamp, I was introduced to something called <strong>vibe coding</strong>.
      I won’t lie — I went with it.
      At some point, I forgot the importance of writing and understanding code on my own.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bugs became easier to debug, and coding didn’t always require deep effort.
      I could build an entire working system within days.
      I’m not complaining — but I want to be a pro. Not just code for the sake of it, 
      but actually understand what I'm doing. Put in blood, sweat and  tears into it.
    </p>

    <p>
      So I’m starting again — not from scratch,
      but with intention.
      I’ll be back here next year to see how consistent I’ve been.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Go go TechyShie 🚀</strong></p>
